Live time countdown to 10:00 pm ET.  At 10 pm everyday, the draw happens, countdown time resets, winners get a congratulations popup, list of previous draw winners updates to list current winners... \r\n10 tickets win $100 each, 6 tickets win $50 each and 20 tickets win $10 each (let them know the win amount and number of winners will increase as more members participate)\r\nIf the number of tickets bought by all contestants is not 300,000 at 10 pm when the draw is happening, everyone who participated should be refunded and no winners (have a message saying that number of tickets in the draw did not meet the requirements and apologise). \r\nSign up page... first and last name (let people know that the name used should match the names on bank details for withdrawal to be successful) email, phone number (include country code), country (have them select from a list of countries), referral code(optional), create and confirm password (8 characters with special characters, uppercase and lower case and number for password requirements) and a hide and unhide typed password thing, and then accept of terms and conditions... all fields must be filled in correctly \r\n\r\nIn Login, email and password... then a forgot password place \r\n\r\nWallet page.  People watch ads to gain a ticket per ad watched ... those tickets are to get in the daily draw.  Everytime after watching 5 ads continuously, the button goes inactive/greyed out, they're told that more ads will be available in 10 min, after 10 min countdown, the button becomes active again and they can continue to watch ads.  And they don't need to see 0/5 ads watched so don't put that....).  To be rewarded, one must watch an ad to the end...\r\nPeople can withdraw from their wallet using bank transfer, crypto (USDT (TRC-20 network), BTC (network Bitcoin), ETH (ERC-20 network)), Paypal (ask for email).  Have it say that all withdrawals are done man6ually and will take 3 to 5 business days (make it polite and enticing).

You want a sophisticated and user-friendly React Native app named \"Fundee Cash\" for daily draws, ad-based ticket earning, and wallet management. You've provided detailed specifications for the app's features, design, and functionality.\n\nHere's a plan to approach building the app:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Home Screen:** Display a live countdown to the daily draw (10 PM ET), a ticket purchase option (unique 9-digit number), and a list of previous draw winners. Implement the draw logic, including winner selection, refund conditions (if ticket sales are below 300,000), and winner announcements.\n-   **Sign-Up/Login:** Create a secure sign-up process with comprehensive input validation (name matching bank details, password requirements, etc.) and a standard login page with a \"Forgot Password\" option.\n-   **Wallet:** Enable users to earn tickets by watching ads (with cooldown periods) and withdraw funds via bank transfer, crypto (USDT, BTC, ETH), or PayPal. Display withdrawal processing times and minimum withdrawal amounts.\n-   **Profile:** Allow users to edit their email, phone number, profile photo, and password. Include options for signing out and deleting their account.\n-   **Referral:** Display the user's unique referral code and a shareable link. Track referrals and award tickets accordingly.\n-   **Help:** Provide a help page with FAQs, terms and conditions (link to readable document), and a contact form for support inquiries.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n-   **Colors:**\n    -   Base color: #bb86fc (primary theme color)\n    -   Primary text color: Dark gray or black for readability\n    -   Accent colors: Complementary colors to #bb86fc for interactive elements and highlights\n    -   Highlight shades: Lighter shades of #bb86fc for subtle emphasis\n-   **Typography:**\n    -   Modern, clean fonts like \"System\" or \"Roboto\" for a professional look.\n\n**Backend:**\n\n-   Supabase will be required to handle user authentication, data storage (user profiles, ticket purchases, draw history, wallet balances, referral codes), and potentially ad tracking.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** Set up the React Native project with Expo.\n2.  **UI Components:** Create reusable UI components (buttons, input fields, list items, modals, etc.) based on the design specifications.\n3.  **Screen Implementation:** Build each screen (Home, Sign-Up, Login, Wallet, Profile, Help) with its respective functionality.\n4.  **Backend Integration:** Integrate Supabase for authentication, data storage, and real-time updates (draw results, wallet transactions, etc.).\n5.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test all features and functionalities on different devices and screen sizes.\n6.  **Refinement:** Refine the UI/UX based on testing feedback.\n\nBefore I can proceed, you'll need to enable Supabase by pressing the Supabase button and connecting to a project. You might need to create a project in Supabase first.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-09-30T20:18:11.027576"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build the Fundee Cash app!
